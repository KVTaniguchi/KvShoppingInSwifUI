# KvShoppingInSwifUI

Just learning SwiftUI by trying to build a mockup of a shopping app.
- a shop home page with "ads" you click on to lead to a product listing page
- a product listing page with basic info you'd expect to find on a PLP
- a product detail page
- an add to cart feature
- a cart
- a checkout page
